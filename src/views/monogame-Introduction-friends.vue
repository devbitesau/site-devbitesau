<h2>Friends?</h2>
<p>There are a number of projects that could be considered friends of XNA. Some of these
aim to extend MonoGame itself, others have an equal focus to maintaining XNA compatibility.</p>
<h2><a href="https://flatredball.com/">FlatRedBall</a> <img src="@/assets/monogame/Introduction/flatredball.png" alt="logo"></h2>
<p>The closest thing to a scene manager youâ€™ll find. FlatRedBall is an extension to MonoGame that brings
with it a scene editor, visual editors for tile components and some core game engine functions.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/isadorasophia/murder">Murder Engine</a> <img src="@/assets/monogame/Introduction/murderengine.png" alt="logo"></h2>
<p>A pixel art ECS game engine built on top of FNA. Still in development but looks incredibly promising.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/kniEngine/kni">KNI</a></h2>
<p>A fork of MonoGame that aims to bring MonoGame to web builds.</p>
<h2><a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/">FNA</a></h2>
<p>This project aims to support the original XNA api as truthfully as possible. It is widely compatible
with MonoGame (They share origin with XNA) but runs a slightly different philosophy. It currently does
not support Android builds, but has arguably better platform support elsewhere with the recent
.NET 8 / AOT updates.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/FNA-NET/FNA">FNANET</a></h2>
<p>A fork of FNA focused on bringing an easier development process and adding support for Android.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/cpt-max/MonoGame">Compute Fork</a></h2>
<p>A fork of MonoGame that aims to add support for compute shaders.</p>
