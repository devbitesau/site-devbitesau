## The GDD
What is a Game Design Document (GDD for short)?

Generally speaking, it is highly detailed covering all aspects of the game. From high level concepts as genre and target audience
right down to control support and target platforms. It also helps to keep development organized and in line with the
end goal.

## Is It Needed?

Probably not, but it's definitely not a bad idea to at least jot down some pointers on what the
finished product should look and feel like. The larger the concept, the more you should think about making one.

In some cases you may actually need to create one, even if you have already finished the game. Publishers and console
applications will quite often ask for one to be created if you haven't. They'll use this to ensure your game is a good 
fit for their environment.
