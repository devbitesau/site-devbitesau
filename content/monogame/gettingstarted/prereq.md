- .NET 6 sdk or above.
- A text editor of choice

That's it, really. Technically you can use the console commands and notepad to build up a game.

It would not be a pleasant experience, but you could.

At it's core, .NET handles the compilation of code into a finished product, and MonoGame itself can be installed through
the builtin Nuget package manager. 

Strongly recommend against this approach, as even a simple code editor like Visual 
Studio Code has tools and plugins to make development and debugging infinitely easier.

## Recommended

### Environment

- .NET 8 sdk
- ~~.NET 6 sdk~~ Monogame runs happily in .NET 8
- Monogame Project Templates
- (Android Only) .NET Android Workload
- (Android Only) Android Studio
- (IOS Only) .NET Ios Workload

### Supported Editors / IDEs

- Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition is fine)
- Visual Studio Code (Cross Platform)
- Jetbrains Rider (Paid, Cross platform)

### Extras

It would be highly recommended to have some sort of image editor handy. Even if you're using free / premade assets from 
else where, it can be useful to change colours and resize before importing.
