## Friends?
There are a number of projects that could be considered friends of XNA. Some of these
aim to extend MonoGame itself, others have an equal focus to maintaining XNA compatibility.


## [FlatRedBall](https://flatredball.com/) ![logo](flatredball.png)

The closest thing to a scene manager you'll find. FlatRedBall is an extension to MonoGame that brings
with it a scene editor, visual editors for tile components and some core game engine functions.

## [Murder Engine](https://github.com/isadorasophia/murder) ![logo](murderengine.png)

A pixel art ECS game engine built on top of FNA. Still in development but looks incredibly promising.

## [KNI](https://github.com/kniEngine/kni)

A fork of MonoGame that aims to bring MonoGame to web builds. 

## [FNA](https://fna-xna.github.io/)

This project aims to support the original XNA api as truthfully as possible. It is widely compatible 
with MonoGame (They share origin with XNA) but runs a slightly different philosophy. It currently does 
not support Android builds, but has arguably better platform support elsewhere with the recent
.NET 8 / AOT updates. 

## [FNANET](https://github.com/FNA-NET/FNA)

A fork of FNA focused on bringing an easier development process and adding support for Android.

## [Compute Fork](https://github.com/cpt-max/MonoGame)

A fork of MonoGame that aims to add support for compute shaders.
